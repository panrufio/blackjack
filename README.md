Demonstration of coding capabilities with Black Jack


Blackjack Coding Problem

For this problem, you will be coding a simplified version of the game Blackjack. You may use Java and/or Groovy.

The object of the game is to get as close to or equal to 21 without going over. The rules are as follows:

   There will be only 2 players – a “human” player and a dealer
   The players are each dealt 2 cards to start the hand
   The player can choose to hit or stand with any amount
   The dealer must hit if his cards total less than 17 and stand otherwise
   If the player’s or dealer’s cards total over 21, they bust and their turn is over
   If either player has 21 with their first two cards, they win (unless they both have 21 on their first two cards, in which case it is a tie)
   If both players bust, the dealer wins
   If both players have the same score, they tie
   The player always takes their turn before the dealer
   All cards count as their face value, except A which can be 1 or 11 and J, Q, K all count as 10
   The deck should be shuffled before each game
   You do not need to implement advanced blackjack rules (split, double or insurance)
   Only one deck will be used per game

You must create a model of the blackjack game and entities involved (no UI components required). Unit tests should be included for your code. You may use 3rd party support libraries (e.g. Apache commons).

Please submit a zip or tar file containing everything needed to run your test code, and a README file indicating how to run it. You may use standard build systems (ant, maven, gradle) or write a batch/bash script file to run your code.
